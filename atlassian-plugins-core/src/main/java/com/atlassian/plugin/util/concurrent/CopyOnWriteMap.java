/**
 * A thread-safe variant of {@link Map} in which all mutative operations (the
 * "destructive" operations described by {@link Map} put, remove and so on) are
 * implemented by making a fresh copy of the underlying map.
 * <p>
 * This is ordinarily too costly, but may be <em>more</em> efficient than
 * alternatives when traversal operations vastly out-number mutations, and is
 * useful when you cannot or don't want to synchronize traversals, yet need to
 * preclude interference among concurrent threads. The "snapshot" style
 * iterators on the collections returned by {@link #entrySet()},
 * {@link #keySet()} and {@link #values()} use a reference to the internal map
 * at the point that the iterator was created. This map never changes during the
 * lifetime of the iterator, so interference is impossible and the iterator is
 * guaranteed not to throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt>. The
 * iterators will not reflect additions, removals, or changes to the list since
 * the iterator was created. Removing elements via these iterators is not
 * supported. The mutable operations on these collections (remove, retain etc.)
 * are supported but as with the {@link Map} interface, add and addAll are not
 * and throw {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
 * <p>
 * The actual copy is performed by an abstract {@link #copy(Map)} method. The
 * method is responsible for the underlying Map implementation (for instance a
 * {@link HashMap}, {@link TreeMap}, {@link LinkedHashMap} etc.) and therefore
 * the semantics of what this map will cope with as far as null keys and values,
 * iteration ordering etc. See the note below about suitable candidates for
 * underlying Map implementations
 * <p>
 * There are supplied implementations for the common Collections {@link Map}
 * implementations via the {@link CopyOnWriteMaps} static factory methods.
 * <p>
 * Collection views of the keys, values and entries are modifiable and will
 * cause a copy.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Please note</strong> that the thread-safety guarantees are limited to
 * the thread-safety of the non-mutative (non-destructive) operations of the
 * underlying map implementation. For instance some implementations such as
 * {@link WeakHashMap} and {@link LinkedHashMap} with access ordering are
 * actually structurally modified by the {@link #get(Object)} method and are
 * therefore not suitable candidates as delegates for this class.
 * 
 * @param <K> the key type
 * @param <V> the value type
 * @author Jed Wesley-Smith
 * @deprecated since 2.5.0 please use the
 *             {@link com.atlassian.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteMap} instead as
 *             it has some important features and some bug fixes. This version
 *             is no longer maintained.
