This is where we keep the source for test jars. Normally you don't have
to look in here, because the jars will be built and put in the main
tree as binaries.

Run 'mvn package' in this directory, and copy
simpletest/target/atlassian-plugins-osgi-simpletest-1.0.jar into
../src/test/resources/testjars
